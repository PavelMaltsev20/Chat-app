# Chat, messenger (app, java).

My first big project.

Many framework, libraries and classes have been used in this project like: 

firebase, broadcast receiver, services, shared preference, intent, notifications, fragments and etc.

A brief introduction to what this application can do:

The first and most important registration of a new user.

An example of how a message is sent from one phone to another.

The second phone is already signed in

Here you can see that after the user read the message the green icon disappeared.

Let's try to reply to the message.

Below is an example of how online/offline status work.

Another important thing for messenger is notifications.

It is also possible to search for users.

Now there will be examples of setting up the application and user profile:

First, let's change the theme of the application and save it in a shared preference.

Further there will be examples of changing the username, user image and password.

The last one is changing the user's email and trying to log in with a new email.

You can also see that the email was changed in firebase.
