# Chat, messenger (app, java).

My first big project.

Many framework, libraries and classes have been used in this project like: 

firebase, broadcast receiver, services, shared preference, intent, notifications, fragments and etc.

A brief introduction to what this application can do:

The first and most important registration of a new user.

Here you can see that after the user read the message the green icon disappeared.
